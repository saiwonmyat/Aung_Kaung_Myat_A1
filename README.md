# CP1404 2019 SP1 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP1804, IT@JCU

By: **your name here**  

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).  
**Edit this README file**, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name and details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code (over one week).
